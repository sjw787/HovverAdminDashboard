✅ SES MIGRATION COMPLETE - WAITING FOR VERIFICATION
===================================================

🎉 SUCCESS! SES has been migrated to the correct account!

WHAT HAPPENED
-------------
1. ✅ SES was in wrong account (777653593792 - iamadmin-general)
2. ✅ Deleted SES from wrong account
3. ✅ Set up SES in correct account (052869941234 - iamadmin-dev)
4. ✅ Updated DNS records in Route53 with new tokens
5. ⏳ Waiting for DNS verification (5-30 minutes)

CURRENT STATUS
--------------
Domain: samwylock.com
Account: 052869941234 (iamadmin-dev) ✅
Region: us-east-1
Verification: PENDING ⏳
Expected: Success in 5-30 minutes

WHY THE DNS ERROR?
------------------
The DNS record error you saw was because:
- SES was in the wrong account with different tokens
- DNS records didn't match those tokens
- NOW: SES is in the correct account with matching DNS records

WHAT TO DO NOW
--------------
⏰ WAIT 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation

Then check status:
  python setup_ses.py --check-status samwylock.com

Once you see "✅ Success", proceed to configure Cognito:
  See SES_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.txt for detailed instructions

QUICK VERIFICATION
------------------
Check status anytime:
  .\verify-ses-status.ps1

When both show "Success", you're ready to configure Cognito!
  - Domain Verification: Success
  - DKIM Verification: Success

NEXT: CONFIGURE COGNITO
-----------------------
Once verified, update Cognito User Pool (us-east-1_vqzmBxIoP):
1. Go to Cognito > Messaging > Email
